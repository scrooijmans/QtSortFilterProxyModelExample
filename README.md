# QtSortFilterProxyModelExample
The project is a Qt application demonstrating the use of the QSortFilterProxyModel in conjunction with QTreeView for sorting and filtering data. It includes a simple model representing well data with associated log types. The application allows users to filter the data based on a regular expression pattern and choose the filter column dynamically.
