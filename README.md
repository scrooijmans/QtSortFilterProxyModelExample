# QtSortFilterProxyModelExample
The project is a Qt application demonstrating the use of the QSortFilterProxyModel in conjunction with QTreeView for sorting and filtering data. It includes a simple model representing well data with associated log types. The application allows users to filter the data based on a regular expression pattern and choose the filter column dynamically.

## Overview

The application demonstrates the basic implementation of QSortFilterProxyModel to enable sorting and filtering of data presented in a QTreeView. Users can filter data based on a regular expression pattern and dynamically choose the filter column.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Qt development environment installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/QtSortFilterProxyModelExample.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred Qt development environment.

3. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, you will see the original model data on the left and the sorted/filtered data on the right.

2. Use the "Filter pattern" input to enter a regular expression for filtering.

3. Choose a filter column from the "Filter column" dropdown.

4. The sorted and filtered results will be displayed in real-time on the right.
